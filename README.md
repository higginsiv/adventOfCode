https://adventofcode.com/

Run the code for a given Day (X) and Problem (Y) with the following. Answers
will be printed to the console
- node yyyy/js/DayX/problemY.js

### Notes

- Every user will have unique input, and the committed input.txt 
is simply my own.
  
- Part 1 is usually kept in its unoptimal form even after learning more in Part 2. This is done to allow a view into my thought process

- Some days will have extra solutions added in but the primary solutions are in problem1.js and problem2.js
