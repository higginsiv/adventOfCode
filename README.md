## Create Days
```
npm run create yyyy dd
```

## Solve
```
npm run solve yyyy dd [p] [--legacy]
```
Omitting [p] will cause both parts to run for the given day

The ```--legacy``` flag will run older problems that have not been converted to be function based. Older problems handle their own input and output. Problems worked more recently only handle solving the problem, taking input as a parameter and returning output to be printed to the console. Eventually all problems will be updated to be function based and the ```--legacy``` flag will be retired

- Every user will have unique input, and the committed input.txt 
is simply my own.
